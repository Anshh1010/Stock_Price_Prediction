# Stock_Price_Prediction
Time series based project for predicting the stock price of a company using previous prices


For the dataset, we can download the stock performance of any stock from Yahoo! Finance.   
I have downloaded the data for stock: ADANIENT.NS.  

##  Libraries used:  
Numpy   
Pandas     
Sklearn    

As part of the data cleaning process, I have dropped the NA values from the dataset and created a different function to divide the dataset into the training and testing data.  
X_Lately contains the data that we will use for predictions.
I have trained a Linear Regression Model.  
The model had an accuracy score of 97.7%.  
Thank you!
